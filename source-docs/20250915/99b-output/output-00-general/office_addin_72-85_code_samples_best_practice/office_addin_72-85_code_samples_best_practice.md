# **Office Add-in development lifecycle**

06/13/2025

All Office Add-ins are built upon the Office Add-ins platform. They share a common framework through which add-in capabilities are implemented. This means that regardless of whether you're creating an add-in for Excel, Outlook, or another Office application, you can have features such as dialog boxes, add-in commands, task panes, and single sign-on (SSO).

For any add-in you build, you need to understand the following concepts.

- Office application and platform availability
- Office JavaScript API programming patterns
- How to specify an add-in's settings and capabilities in the manifest file
- Troubleshooting your add-in
- Publishing your add-in

For the best foundation for these common features and application-specific implementations, review the following documentation.

# **Best practices for developing Office Addins**

07/30/2025

Great add-ins provide unique, compelling functionality that extend Office apps in visually appealing ways. To build a successful add-in, you'll need to create an engaging first-time user experience, design a polished UI, and optimize performance. Follow the best practices in this article to help your users complete tasks quickly and efficiently.

#### 7 **Note**

If you plan to **publish** your add-in to AppSource and make it available within the Office experience, make sure that you conform to the **Commercial marketplace certification policies**. For example, to pass validation, your add-in must work across all platforms that support the methods that you define (for more information, see **section 1120.3** and the **[Office Add-in application and availability page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/requirement-sets)**).

### **Provide clear value**

Build add-ins that help users complete tasks quickly and efficiently. Focus on scenarios that make sense for Office apps, such as:

- Make core authoring tasks faster and easier with fewer interruptions.
- Enable new scenarios within Office.
- Embed complementary services within Office apps.
- Improve the Office experience to enhance productivity.

Make sure users understand your add-in's value immediately by creating an engaging first-run experience.

- Make your add-in's benefits clear in the title and description. Don't rely only on your brand to communicate what your add-in does.
- Ensure your add-in provides sufficient value to justify users' investment. It shouldn't be just a simple utility or have limited scope.
- If your add-in targets larger organizations and enterprises, several AppSource requirements differ from those of a general commercial marketplace add-in. For more information, see the [submission FAQ.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace-offers/appsource-submission-faq#if-my-app-targets-enterprises--how-does-that-affect-my-submission-)

## **Create an engaging first-run experience**

New users are still deciding whether to use or abandon your add-in after downloading it from the store. Here's how to win them over.

- **Make the next steps clear.** Use videos, placemats, paging panels, or other resources to guide users through your add-in.
- **Lead with value, not registration.** Reinforce your add-in's value proposition when it launches rather than immediately asking users to sign in.
- **Provide helpful guidance.** Include teaching UI to guide users and make the experience feel personal.

- **Show users what to expect.** If your content add-in binds to data in the user's document, include sample data or a template to show users the expected data format.

{9}------------------------------------------------

- **Offer free trials.** If your add-in requires a subscription, make some functionality available without one.
- **Simplify sign-up.** Prefill information like email and display name, and skip email verifications when possible.
- **Avoid pop-ups.** If you must use them, guide users on how to enable your pop-up window.

For patterns you can apply when developing your first-run experience, see UX design patterns for Office Add-ins.

## **Use add-in commands**

Provide relevant UI entry points for your add-in by using add-in commands. These commands help users discover and access your add-in's functionality directly from the Office ribbon. For details and design best practices, see add-in commands.

# **Apply UX design principles**

Follow these key principles to create add-ins that feel native to Office:

- **Match the Office experience.** Ensure your add-in's look, feel, and functionality complement the Office experience. See Design the UI of Office Add-ins.

{10}------------------------------------------------

- **Prioritize content over chrome.** Avoid unnecessary UI elements that don't add value to the user experience.
- **Keep users in control.** Make sure users understand important decisions and can easily reverse actions your add-in performs.
- **Use branding thoughtfully.** Inspire trust and help orient users, but don't overwhelm or advertise to them.
- **Minimize scrolling.** Optimize for 1366 x 768 resolution.
- **Use licensed images only.** Avoid legal and branding issues that come from unlicensed images.
- **Write clearly.** Use clear and simple language in your add-in.
- **Design for accessibility.** Make your add-in easy for all users to interact with and accommodate assistive technologies like screen readers. See our accessibility guidelines.
- **Support all platforms and input methods.** Design for mouse/keyboard and touch. Ensure your UI responds well to different form factors.

### **Optimize for touch**

Touch support is essential for modern Office add-ins.

- **Detect touch support.** Use the [Context.touchEnabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office/office.context#office-office-context-touchenabled-member) property to detect whether the Office app your add-in runs on is touch-enabled.
#### 7 **Note**

This property isn't supported in Outlook.

- **Size controls appropriately.** Make sure all controls work well with touch interaction. For example, buttons need adequate touch targets, and input boxes should be large enough for users to enter text easily.
- **Don't rely on hover or right-click.** These input methods aren't available on touch devices.
- **Support both orientations.** Ensure your add-in works in both portrait and landscape modes. Remember that on touch devices, the soft keyboard might hide part of your addin.
- **Test on real devices.** Use sideloading to test your add-in on actual touch devices.

{11}------------------------------------------------

## **Optimize and monitor add-in performance**

Performance directly impacts user satisfaction. Follow these guidelines to keep your add-in fast and responsive:

- **Aim for quick loading.** Your add-in should load in 500 ms or less to create the perception of fast UI responses.
- **Respond quickly to interactions.** All user interactions should respond in under one second.
- **Show progress for long operations.** Provide loading indicators for operations that take time.
- **Use a CDN.** Host images, resources, and common libraries on a content delivery network (CDN). Load as much as possible from one place.
- **Follow web optimization best practices.** In production, use only minified versions of libraries. Load only the resources you need and optimize how they're loaded.
- **Provide feedback for longer operations.** When operations take time to execute, give users feedback based on the thresholds in the following table. For more information, see Resource limits and performance optimization for Office Add-ins.

| Interaction<br>class | Target        | Upper<br>bound | Human perception                                                        |
|----------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Instant              | <=50 ms       | 100 ms         | No noticeable delay.                                                    |
| Fast                 | 50-100 ms     | 200 ms         | Minimally noticeable delay. No feedback necessary.                      |
| Typical              | 100-300<br>ms | 500 ms         | Quick, but too slow to be described as fast. No<br>feedback necessary.  |
| Responsive           | 300-500<br>ms | 1 second       | Not fast, but still feels responsive. No feedback<br>necessary.         |
| Continuous           | >500 ms       | 5 seconds      | Medium wait, no longer feels responsive. Might need<br>feedback.        |
| Captive              | >500 ms       | 10 seconds     | Long, but not long enough to do something else.<br>Might need feedback. |
| Extended             | >500 ms       | >10<br>seconds | Long enough to do something else while waiting.<br>Might need feedback. |

{12}------------------------------------------------

| Interaction<br>class | Target        | Upper<br>bound | Human perception                        |
|----------------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Long running         | >5<br>seconds | >1 minute      | Users will certainly do something else. |

- **Monitor your service.** Use telemetry to monitor service health and user success.
- **Minimize data exchanges.** Reduce data exchanges between your add-in and the Office document. For more information, see Avoid using the context.sync method in loops.

### **Publish and market your add-in**

Ready to share your add-in with the world? Here's how to get started.

- **Create a Partner Center account.** This process can take time, so if you plan to publish to AppSource, start early. See [Partner Center account.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace-offers/open-a-developer-account)
- **Create an effective AppSource listing.** Follow these tips:
	- Use succinct, descriptive titles (128 characters or fewer).
	- Write short, compelling descriptions that answer "What problem does this add-in solve?"
	- Convey your add-in's value proposition clearly in the title and description. Don't rely only on your brand.
