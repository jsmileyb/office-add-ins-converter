# **Debug your add-in with runtime logging**

Article â€¢ 11/12/2024

You can use runtime logging to debug your add-in's manifest as well as several installation errors. This feature can help you identify and fix issues with your manifest that are not detected by XSD schema validation, such as a mismatch between resource IDs. Runtime logging is particularly useful for debugging add-ins that implement add-in commands and Excel custom functions.

#### 7 **Note**

The runtime logging feature is currently available for Office 2016 or later on desktop.

#### ) **Important**

Runtime Logging affects performance. Turn it on only when you need to debug issues with your add-in manifest.

## **Use runtime logging from the command line**

Enabling runtime logging from the command line is the fastest way to use this logging tool.

#### ) **Important**

The office-addin-dev-settings tool is not supported on Mac. See the section **Runtime logging on Mac** for Mac-specific instructions.

- To enable runtime logging:
command line

```
npx office-addin-dev-settings runtime-log --enable
```
- To enable runtime logging only for a specific file, use the same command with a filename:

{1}------------------------------------------------

```
command line
```
npx office-addin-dev-settings runtime-log --enable [filename.txt]

- To disable runtime logging:
command line

npx office-addin-dev-settings runtime-log --disable

- To display whether runtime logging is enabled:
command line

```
npx office-addin-dev-settings runtime-log
```
- To display help within the command line for runtime logging:
command line

```
npx office-addin-dev-settings runtime-log --help
```
## **Runtime logging on Mac**

- 1. Make sure that you are running Office 2016 desktop build **16.27.19071500** or later.
- 2. Open **Terminal** and set a runtime logging preference by using the defaults command:

```
command line
defaults write <bundle id> CEFRuntimeLoggingFile -string <file_name>
```
<bundle id> identifies which the host for which to enable runtime logging. <file_name> is the name of the text file to which the log will be written.

Set <bundle id> to one of the following values to enable runtime logging for the corresponding application.

- com.microsoft.Word
- com.microsoft.Excel
- com.microsoft.Powerpoint

{2}------------------------------------------------

- com.microsoft.Outlook
The following example enables runtime logging for Word and then opens the log file.

command line

```
defaults write com.microsoft.Word CEFRuntimeLoggingFile -string
"runtime_logs.txt"
open ~/library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/runtime_logs.txt
```
#### 7 **Note**

You'll need to restart Office after running the defaults command to enable runtime logging.

To turn off runtime logging, use the defaults delete command:

command line

defaults delete <bundle id> CEFRuntimeLoggingFile

The following example will turn off runtime logging for Word.

command line

defaults delete com.microsoft.Word CEFRuntimeLoggingFile

### **Use runtime logging to troubleshoot issues with your manifest**

To use runtime logging to troubleshoot issues loading an add-in:

- 1. Sideload your add-in for testing.
#### 7 **Note**

We recommend that you sideload only the add-in that you are testing to minimize the number of messages in the log file.

- 2. If nothing happens and you don't see your add-in (and it's not appearing in the add-ins dialog box), open the log file.

{3}------------------------------------------------

- 3. Search the log file for your add-in ID, which you define in your manifest. In the log file, this ID is labeled SolutionId .
### **Known issues with runtime logging**

You might see messages in the log file that are confusing or that are classified incorrectly. For example:

- The message Medium Current host not in add-in's host list followed by Unexpected Parsed manifest targeting different host is incorrectly classified as an error.
- If you see the message Unexpected Add-in is missing required manifest fields DisplayName and it doesn't contain a SolutionId, the error is most likely not related to the add-in you are debugging.
- Any Monitorable messages are expected errors from a system point of view. Sometimes they indicate an issue with your manifest, such as a misspelled element that was skipped but didn't cause the manifest to fail.

# **Debug a function command with a nonshared runtime**

06/17/2025

#### ) **Important**

If your add-in is **configured to use a shared runtime**, debug the code behind the function command just as you would the code behind a task pane. See **Debug Office Add-ins** and note that a function command in an add-in with a **shared runtime** is *not* a special case as described in that article.

#### 7 **Note**

This article assumes that you're familiar with **function commands**.

Function commands don't have a UI, so a debugger can't be attached to the process in which the function runs on desktop Office. (Outlook add-ins being developed on Windows are an exception to this. See Debug function commands in Outlook add-ins on Windows later in this article.) So function commands, in add-ins with a non-shared runtime, must be debugged in Office on the web where the function runs in the overall browser process. Use the following steps.

- 1. Sideload the add-in in Office on the web, and then select the button or menu item that runs the function command. This is necessary to load the code file for the function command.
- 2. Open the browser's developer tools. This is usually done by pressing F12 . The debugger in the tools attaches to the browser process.
- 3. Apply breakpoints to the code as needed for the function command.
- 4. Rerun the function command. The process stops on your breakpoints.

#### **Tip**

For more detailed information, see **Debug add-ins in Office on the web**.

### **Debug function commands in Outlook add-ins on Windows**

If your development computer is Windows, there's a way that you can debug a function command on Outlook desktop. See Debug function commands in Outlook add-ins.

# **Debug the initialize and onReady functions**

06/17/2025

#### 7 **Note**

This article assumes that you're familiar with **Initialize your Office Add-in**.

The paradox of debugging the [Office.initialize](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office#office-office-initialize-function(1)) and [Office.onReady](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office#office-office-onready-function(1)) functions is that a debugger can only attach to a process that's running, but these functions run immediately as the add-in's runtime process starts up, before a debugger can attach. In most situations, restarting the addin after a debugger is attached doesn't help because restarting the add-in closes the original runtime process *and the attached debugger* and starts a new process that has no debugger attached.

Fortunately, there's an exception. You can debug these functions using Office on the web, with the following steps.

- 1. Sideload and run the add-in in Office on the web. This is usually done by opening an addin's task pane or running a function command. *The add-in runs in the overall browser process, not a separate process as it would in desktop Office.*
- 2. Open the browser's developer tools. This is usually done by pressing F12 . The debugger in the tools attaches to the browser process.
- 3. Apply breakpoints as needed to the code in the Office.initialize or Office.onReady function.
- 4. *Relaunch the add-in's task pane or the function command* just as you did in step 1. This action does *not* close the browser process or the debugger. The Office.initialize or Office.onReady function runs again and processing stops on your breakpoints.

# **Error handling with the application-specific JavaScript APIs**

06/23/2025

When you build an add-in using the application-specific Office JavaScript APIs, be sure to include error handling logic to account for runtime errors. Doing so is critical, due to the asynchronous nature of the APIs.

## **Best practices**

In our [code samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-samples) and Script Lab snippets, you'll notice that every call to Excel.run , PowerPoint.run , or Word.run is accompanied by a catch statement to catch any errors. We recommend that you use the same pattern when you build an add-in using the applicationspecific APIs.

JavaScript

```
$("#run").on("click", () => tryCatch(run));
async function run() {
 await Excel.run(async (context) => {
 // Add your Excel JavaScript API calls here.
 // Await the completion of context.sync() before continuing.
 await context.sync();
 console.log("Finished!");
 });
}
/** Default helper for invoking an action and handling errors. */
async function tryCatch(callback) {
 try {
 await callback();
 } catch (error) {
 // Note: In a production add-in, you'd want to notify the user through your
add-in's UI.
 console.error(error);
 }
}
```
### **API errors**

{8}------------------------------------------------

When an Office JavaScript API request doesn't run successfully, the API returns an error object that contains the following properties.

- **code**: The code property of an error message contains a string that is part of OfficeExtension.ErrorCodes or {application}.ErrorCodes where *{application}* represents Excel, PowerPoint, or Word. For example, the error code "InvalidReference" indicates that the reference is not valid for the specified operation. Error codes are not localized.
- **message**: The message property of an error message contains a summary of the error in the localized string. The error message isn't intended for consumption by end users; you should use the error code and appropriate business logic to determine the error message that your add-in shows to end users.
- **debugInfo**: When present, the debugInfo property of the error message provides additional information that you can use to understand the root cause of the error.

#### 7 **Note**

If you use console.log() to print error messages to the console, those messages are only visible on the server. End users don't see those error messages in the add-in task pane or anywhere in the Office application. To report errors to the user, see **Error notifications**.

#### **Error codes and messages**

The following tables list the errors that application-specific APIs may return.

#### 7 **Note**

The following tables list error messages you may encounter while using the applicationspecific APIs. If you're working with the Common API, see **Office Common API error codes** to learn about relevant error messages.

### **Error notifications**

How you report errors to users depends on the UI system you're using.

- If you're using React as the UI system, use the [Fluent UI](https://react.fluentui.dev/) components and design elements. We recommend that error messages be conveyed with a [Dialog](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/components-dialog--default) component. If the error is in the user's input, configure the [Input](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/components-input--default) component to display the error as bold red text.
#### 7 **Note**

The **[Alert](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/preview-components-alert--default)** component can also be used to report errors to users, but it's currently in preview and shouldn't be used in a production add-in. For information about its release status, see the **[Fluent UI React v9 Component Roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/Fluent-UI-React-v9-Component-Roadmap)** .

- If you're not using React for the UI, consider using the older [Fabric UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui#/get-started/web#fabric-core) components implemented directly in HTML and JavaScript. Some example templates are in the [Office-](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates)[Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates) repository. Take a look especially in the dialog and navigation subfolders. The sample [Excel-Add-in-SalesLeads](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Excel-Add-in-SalesLeads) uses a message banner.

# **Office Common API error codes**

Article â€¢ 12/27/2022

This article documents the error messages you might encounter while using the Common API model. These error codes don't apply to application-specific APIs, such as the Excel JavaScript API or the Word JavaScript API.

See API models to learn more about the differences between the Common API and application-specific API models.

#### **Error codes**

The following table lists the error codes, names, and messages displayed, and the conditions they indicate.

### **When installing an add-in, you see "Error loading add-ins" in the status bar**

- 1. Close Office.
- 2. Check that the time and date are set correctly on your computer. An incorrect time and date can cause issues when verifying the add-in's manifest.
- 3. Verify that the manifest is valid. See Validate an Office Add-in's manifest.
- 4. Restart the add-in.
- 5. Install the add-in again.

If the add-in package was tampered with before installation, this error will occur. Download the add-in again and try to reinstall it. Alternatively, contact the publisher of the add-in for help.

You can also give us feedback: if using Office on Windows or Mac, you can report feedback to the Office extensibility team directly from Office. To do this, select **Help** > **Feedback** > **Report a problem**. Sending a report provides necessary information to understand the issue.

### **Outlook add-in doesn't work correctly**

If an Outlook add-in running on Windows and using Internet Explorer is not working correctly, try turning on script debugging in Internet Explorer.

- Go to **Tools** > **Internet Options** > **Advanced**.
- Under **Browsing**, uncheck **Disable script debugging (Internet Explorer)** and **Disable script debugging (Other)**.

We recommend that you uncheck these settings only to troubleshoot the issue. If you leave them unchecked, you will get prompts when you browse. After the issue is resolved, check **Disable script debugging (Internet Explorer)** and **Disable script debugging (Other)** again.

## **Add-in doesn't activate in Office**

If the add-in doesn't activate when the user performs the following steps.

- 1. Signs in with their Microsoft account in the Office application.

{30}------------------------------------------------

- 2. Enables two-step verification for their Microsoft account.
- 3. Verifies their identity when prompted when they try to insert an add-in.

Verify that the latest Office updates are installed, or update with the [Windows Installer.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/office-updates-msi)

## **Add-in dialog box cannot be displayed**

When using an Office Add-in, the user is asked to allow a dialog box to be displayed. The user chooses **Allow**, and the following error message occurs.

"The security settings in your browser prevent us from creating a dialog box. Try a different browser, or configure your browser so that [URL] and the domain shown in your address bar are in the same security zone."

| Notification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

#### ãƒŽ **Expand table**

| Affected browsers | Affected platforms |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Microsoft Edge    | Office on the web  |

To resolve the issue, end users or administrators can add the domain of the add-in to the list of trusted sites in the Microsoft Edge browser.

To add a URL to your list of trusted sites:

- 1. In **Control Panel**, go to **Internet options** > **Security**.
- 2. Select the **Trusted sites** zone, and choose **Sites**.

{31}------------------------------------------------

- 3. Enter the URL that appears in the error message, and choose **Add**.
- 4. Try to use the add-in again. If the problem persists, verify the settings for the other security zones and ensure that the add-in domain is in the same zone as the URL that is displayed in the address bar of the Office application.

This issue occurs when the Dialog API is used in pop-up mode. To prevent this issue from occurring, use the [displayInFrame](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office/office.ui) flag. This requires that your page support display within an iframe. The following example shows how to use the flag.

```
JavaScript
Office.context.ui.displayDialogAsync(startAddress, {displayInIFrame:true},
callback);
```
## **Add-in won't upgrade**

You may see the following error when deploying an updated manifest for your add-in: ADD-IN WARNING: This add-in is currently upgrading. Please close the current message or appointment, and re-open in a few moments.

When you add features or fix bugs in your add-in, you'll need to deploy the updates. If your add-in is deployed by one or more admins to their organizations, some manifest changes will require the admin to consent to the updates. Users remain on the existing version of the addin until the admin consents to the updates. The following manifest changes will require the admin to consent again.

- Changes to requested permissions. See Requesting permissions for API use in add-ins and Understanding Outlook add-in permissions.
- Additional or changed [Scopes.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/manifest/scopes) (Not applicable if the add-in uses the unified manifest for Microsoft 365.)
- Additional or changed [Outlook events.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/autolaunch)

#### 7 **Note**

Whenever you make a change to the manifest, you must raise the version number of the manifest.

- If the add-in uses the add-in only manifest, see **[Version element](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/manifest/version)**.
- If the add-in uses the unified manifest, see **[version property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/extensibility/schema/root#version)**.

# **Troubleshoot development errors with Office Add-ins**

Article â€¢ 02/12/2025

Here's a list of common issues you may encounter while developing an Office Add-in.

#### **Tip**

Clearing the Office cache often fixes issues related to stale code. This guarantees the latest manifest is uploaded, using the current file names, menu text, and other command elements. To learn more, see **Clear the Office cache**.

### **Add-in doesn't load in task pane or other issues with the add-in manifest**

See Validate an Office Add-in's manifest and Debug your add-in with runtime logging to debug add-in manifest issues.

## **Ribbon customizations are not rendering as expected**

- With the add-in sideloaded and running, paste the URLs for the add-in's ribbon icons into a browser's navigation bar and see if the icon files open.
- By default, add-in errors connected to the Office UI are suppressed. You can turn on these error messages with the following steps.
	- 1. With the add-in removed, open the **File** tab of the Office application.
	- 2. Select **Options**.
	- 3. In the **Options** dialog, select **Advanced**.
	- 4. In the **General** section (the **Developers** section for Outlook), enable **Show add-in user interface errors**.

Sideload the add-in again and see if there are any errors.

## **Changes to add-in commands including ribbon buttons and menu items do not take effect**

{34}------------------------------------------------

Clearing the cache helps ensure the latest version of your add-in's manifest is being used. To clear the Office cache, follow the instructions in Clear the Office cache. If you're using Office on the web, clear your browser's cache through the browser's UI.

## **Add-in commands from old development addins stay on ribbon even after the cache is cleared**

Sometimes buttons or menus from an add-in that you were developing in the past appears on the ribbon when you run an Office application even after you have cleared the cache. Try these techniques:

- If you develop add-ins on more than one computer and your user settings are synchronized across the computers, try clearing the Office cache on all the computers. Shut down all Office applications on all the computers, and then clear the cache on all of them before you open any Office application on any of them.
- If you published the manifest of the old add-in to a network share, shut down all Office applications, clear the cache, and then *be sure that the manifest for the addin is removed from the shared folder*.

## **Changes to static files, such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS do not take effect**

The browser may be caching these files. To prevent this, turn off client-side caching when developing. The details will depend on what kind of server you are using. In most cases, it involves adding certain headers to the HTTP Responses. We suggest the following set.

- Cache-Control: "private, no-cache, no-store"
- Pragma: "no-cache"
- Expires: "-1"

For an example of doing this in an Node.JS Express server, see [this app.js file](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-samples/tree/main/Samples/auth/Office-Add-in-NodeJS-SSO/Complete/app.js) . For an example in an ASP.NET project, see [this cshtml file](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-samples/blob/main/Samples/auth/Office-Add-in-ASPNET-SSO/Complete/Office-Add-in-ASPNETCore-WebAPI/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml) .

If your add-in is hosted in Internet Information Server (IIS), you could also add the following to the web.config.

{35}------------------------------------------------

```
<system.webServer>
 <staticContent>
 <clientCache cacheControlMode="UseMaxAge"
cacheControlMaxAge="0.00:00:00" cacheControlCustom="must-revalidate" />
 </staticContent>
```
If these steps don't seem to work at first, you may need to clear the browser's cache. Do this through the UI of the browser. Sometimes the Edge cache isn't successfully cleared when you try to clear it in the Edge UI. If that happens, run the following command in a Windows Command Prompt.

```
Bash
del /s /f /q
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.Win32WebViewHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\AC\#!123\IN
etCache\
```
## **Changes made to property values don't happen and there is no error message**

Check the reference documentation for the property to see if it is read-only. Also, the TypeScript definitions for Office JS specify which object properties are read-only. If you attempt to set a read-only property, the write operation will fail silently, with no error thrown. The following example erroneously attempts to set the read-only property [Chart.id.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/excel/excel.chart#excel-excel-chart-id-member) See also Some properties cannot be set directly.

```
JavaScript
// This will do nothing, since `id` is a read-only property.
myChart.id = "5";
```
## **Getting error: "This add-in is no longer available"**

The following are some of the causes of this error. If you discover additional causes, please tell us with the feedback tool at the bottom of the page.

- If you're using Visual Studio, there may be a problem with the sideloading. Close all instances of the Office host and Visual Studio. Restart Visual Studio and try pressing F5 again.

{36}------------------------------------------------

- The add-in's manifest has been removed from its deployment location, such as Centralized Deployment, a SharePoint catalog, or a network share.
- If the add-in only manifest is being used, one of the following may apply.
	- The value of the [ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/manifest/id) element in the manifest has been changed directly in the deployed copy. If for any reason, you want to change this ID, first remove the add-in from the Office host, then replace the original manifest with the changed manifest. You many need to clear the Office cache to remove all traces of the original. See the Clear the Office cache article for instructions on clearing the cache for your operating system.
	- The add-in's manifest has a resid that isn't defined anywhere in the [Resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/manifest/resources) section of the manifest, or there is a mismatch in the spelling of the resid between where it is used and where it is defined in the **<Resources>** section.
	- There is a resid attribute somewhere in the manifest with more than 32 characters. A resid attribute, and the id attribute of the corresponding resource in the **<Resources>** section, cannot be more than 32 characters.
- The add-in has a custom Add-in Command but you are trying to run it on a platform that doesn't support them.

## **Add-in only manifest schema validation errors in Visual Studio projects**

{37}------------------------------------------------

If you're using newer features that require changes to the add-in only manifest file, you may get validation errors in Visual Studio. For example, when adding the **<Runtimes>** element to implement the shared runtime, you may see the following validation error.

#### **The element 'Host' in namespace**

**'http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/taskpaneappversionoverrides' has invalid child element 'Runtimes' in namespace**

**'http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/taskpaneappversionoverrides'**

If this occurs, you can update the XSD files that Visual Studio uses to the latest versions. The latest schema versions are at [\[MS-OWEMXML\]: Appendix A: Full XML Schema.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_file_formats/ms-owemxml/c6a06390-34b8-4b42-82eb-b28be12494a8)

#### **Locate the XSD files**

- 1. Open your project in Visual Studio.
- 2. In **Solution Explorer**, open the manifest.xml file. The manifest is typically in the first project under your solution.
- 3. Select **View** > **Properties Window** ( F4 ).
- 4. Set the cursor selection in the manifest.xml so that the **Properties** window shows the **XML Document** properties.
- 5. In the **Properties** window, select the **Schemas** property, then select the ellipsis (...) to open the **XML Schemas** editor. Here you can find the exact folder location of all schema files your project uses.

| Properties                             |                                      |

**Update the XSD files**

{38}------------------------------------------------

- 1. Open the XSD file you want to update in a text editor. The schema name from the validation error will correlate to the XSD file name. For example, open **TaskPaneAppVersionOverridesV1_0.xsd**.
- 2. Locate the updated schema at [\[MS-OWEMXML\]: Appendix A: Full XML Schema](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_file_formats/ms-owemxml/c6a06390-34b8-4b42-82eb-b28be12494a8). For example, TaskPaneAppVersionOverridesV1_0 is at [taskpaneappversionoverrides](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_file_formats/ms-owemxml/82e93ec5-de22-42a8-86e3-353c8336aa40) [Schema](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_file_formats/ms-owemxml/82e93ec5-de22-42a8-86e3-353c8336aa40).
- 3. Copy the text into your text editor.
- 4. Save the updated XSD file.
- 5. Restart Visual Studio to pick up the new XSD file changes.

You can repeat the previous process for any additional schemas that are out-of-date.

## **When working offline, no Office APIs work**

When you're loading the Office JavaScript Library from a local copy instead of from the CDN, the APIs may stop working if the library isn't up-to-date. If you have been away from a project for a while, reinstall the library to get the latest version. The process varies according to your IDE. Choose one of the following options based on your environment.

- **Visual Studio**: Follow these steps to update the NuGet package.
	- 1. Choose **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Manage Nuget Packages for Solution**.
	- 2. Choose the **Updates** tab.
	- 3. Select "Microsoft.Office.js". Ensure the package source is from nuget.org.
	- 4. In the left pane, choose **Install** and complete the package update process.
- **Any other IDE**: Get the latest npm packages [@microsoft/office-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/office-js) and [@types/office-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/office-js) .

# **Debug event-based or spam-reporting add-ins**

07/16/2025

This article discusses the key debugging stages to enable and set breakpoints in your code as you implement event-based activation or integrated spam reporting in your add-in. Before you proceed, we recommend reviewing the troubleshooting guide for additional steps on how to resolve development errors.

To begin debugging, select the tab for your applicable client.

Windows (classic)

If you used the Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins to create your add-in project (for example, by completing an event-based activation walkthrough), follow the **Created with Yeoman generator** option throughout this article. Otherwise, follow the **Other** steps.

## **Mark your add-in for debugging and set the debugger port**

1. Get your add-in's ID from the manifest.

- **Add-in only manifest**: Use the value of the **<Id>** element child of the root **<OfficeApp>** element.
- **Unified manifest for Microsoft 365**: Use the value of the "id" property of the root anonymous { ... } object.
- 2. In the registry, mark your add-in for debugging.
	- **Created with Yeoman generator**: In a command line window, navigate to the root of your add-in folder then run the following command.

command line

npm start

In addition to building the code and starting the local server, this command sets the data of the

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\WEF\Developer\[Add-in

{41}------------------------------------------------

ID]\UseDirectDebugger registry DWORD value for this add-in to 1 . [Add-in ID] is your add-in's ID from the manifest.

- **Other**: In the
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\WEF\Developer\[Add-in ID]\UseDirectDebugger registry DWORD value, where [Add-in ID] is your addin's ID from the manifest, set its data to 1 .

#### 7 **Note**

If the Developer key (folder) doesn't already exist under

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\WEF\ , complete the following steps to create it.

- a. Right-click (or select and hold) the **WEF** key (folder) and select **New** > **Key**.
- b. Name the new key **Developer**.
- 3. In the registry key

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\WEF\Developer\[Add-in ID] , where [Add-in ID] is your add-in's ID from the manifest, create a new DWORD value with the following configuration.

- **Value name**: DebuggerPort
- **Value data (hexadecimal)**: 00002407

This sets the debugger port to 9223 .

- 4. Start your Office application or restart it if it's already open.
- 5. Perform the action to initiate the event you're developing for, such as creating a new message to initiate the OnNewMessageCompose event or reporting spam messages. The **Debug Event-based handler** dialog should appear. Do *not* interact with the dialog yet.

{42}------------------------------------------------

### **Configure and attach the debugger**

You can debug your add-in using the Microsoft Edge Inspect tool or Visual Studio Code.

#### **Debug with Microsoft Edge**

- 1. Open Microsoft Edge and go to **edge://inspect/#devices**.
- 2. In the **Remote Target** section, look for your add-in using its ID from the manifest. Then, select **Inspect**.

The DevTools window appears.

#### 7 **Note**

It may take some time for your add-in to appear in the **Remote Target** section. You may need to refresh the page for the add-in to appear.

#### 3. In the **Sources** tab, go to **file://** >

**Users/[User]/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Office/16.0/Wef/{[Office profile GUID]}/[Office account encoding]/Javascript/[Add-in ID]_[Add-in Version]_[locale]** > **bundle.js**. For readability, this article refers to the file name as **bundle.js**, but exact name depends on the Office application.

- Excel: **bundle_excel.js**
- Outlook: **bundle.js**
- PowerPoint: **bundle_powerpoint.js**
- Word: **bundle_word.js**

{43}------------------------------------------------

There's no direct method to determine the Office profile GUID or mail account encoding used in the **bundle.js** file path. If you're debugging multiple add-ins simultaneously, the easiest way to access an add-in's **bundle.js** file from the DevTools window is to locate the add-in's ID in the file path.

- 4. In the **bundle.js** file, place breakpoints where you want the debugger to stop.
- 5. Run the debugger.

#### **Debug with Visual Studio Code**

To debug your add-in in Visual Studio Code, you must have at least version 1.56.1 installed.

#### **Configure the debugger**

Configure the debugger in Visual Studio Code. Follow the steps applicable to your add-in project.

#### **Created with Yeoman generator**

- 1. In the command line, run the following to open your add-in project in Visual Studio Code.

```
command line
code .
```
- 2. In Visual Studio Code, open the **./.vscode/launch.json** file and add the following excerpt to your list of configurations. Save your changes.

```
JSON
{
 "name": "Direct Debugging",
 "type": "node",
 "request": "attach",
 "port": 9223,
 "timeout": 600000,
 "trace": true
}
```

{44}------------------------------------------------

#### **Other**

- 1. Create a new folder called **Debugging** (perhaps in your **Desktop** folder).
- 2. Open Visual Studio Code.
- 3. Go to **File** > **Open Folder**, navigate to the folder you created, then choose **Select Folder**.
- 4. On the Activity Bar, select **Run and Debug** ( Ctrl + Shift + D ).

- 5. Select the **create a launch.json file** link.
- 6. In the **Select Environment** dropdown, select **Edge: Launch** to create a launch.json file.
- 7. Add the following excerpt to your list of configurations. Save your changes.

```
JSON
{
 "name": "Direct Debugging",
 "type": "node",
 "request": "attach",
 "port": 9223,
 "timeout": 600000,
```

{45}------------------------------------------------

#### **Attach the debugger**

}

The **bundle.js** file of an add-in contains the JavaScript code of your add-in. It's created when an Office on Windows application is opened. When Office starts, the **bundle.js** file of each installed add-in is cached in the **Wef** folder of your machine.

- 1. To find the add-in's **bundle.js** file, navigate to the following folder in File Explorer. The text enclosed in [] represents your applicable Office and add-in information.
text

%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Wef\{[Office profile GUID]}\[Office account encoding]\Javascript\[Add-in ID]_[Add-in Version]_[locale]

#### **Tip**

- For readability, this article refers to the file name as **bundle.js**, but exact name depends on the Office application.
	- Excel: **bundle_excel.js**
	- Outlook: **bundle.js**.
	- PowerPoint: **bundle_powerpoint.js**
	- Word: **bundle_word.js**
- There's no direct method to determine the Office profile GUID and account encoding used in the **bundle.js** file path. The most effective approach to locate your add-in's **bundle.js** file is to manually inspect each folder until you locate the **Javascript** folder that contains your add-in's ID.
- The **bundle.js** file is downloaded to the local **Wef** folder when the add-in is first installed. It's refreshed every time the Office application starts or is restarted. If the **bundle.js** file doesn't appear in the **Wef** folder and your add-in is installed or sideloaded, restart Office. For Outlook, you may need to **remove your add-in**, then **sideload** it again.
- 2. Open **bundle.js** in Visual Studio Code.
- 3. Place breakpoints in **bundle.js** where you want the debugger to stop.

{46}------------------------------------------------

- 4. In the **DEBUG** dropdown, select **Direct Debugging**, then select the **Start Debugging** icon.
## **Run the debugger**

After confirming that the debugger is attached, return to the Office application. In the **Debug Event-based handler** dialog, select **OK**.

You can now reach your breakpoints to debug your event-based activation or spamreporting code.

#### ) **Important**

Starting in Version 2403 (Build 17425.20000), event-based and spam-reporting addins use the **[V8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev/)** to run JavaScript, regardless of whether debugging is turned on or off. In earlier versions, the Chakra JavaScript engine is used when debugging is off, but the V8 engine may be used when debugging is turned on.

## **Stop the debugger**

To stop debugging the rest of the current Office on Windows session, in the **Debug Eventbased handler** dialog, choose **Cancel**. To re-enable debugging, restart the Office application.

To prevent the **Debug Event-based handler** dialog from popping up and stop debugging for subsequent sessions, delete the associated registry key,

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\WEF\Developer\[Add-in ID]\UseDirectDebugger , or set its value to 0 .

{47}------------------------------------------------

## **Stop the local server**

When you want to stop the local web server and uninstall the add-in, follow the applicable instructions:

- To stop the server, run the following command. If you used npm start , the following command should also uninstall the add-in.

| command line |  |
|--------------|--|
|--------------|--|

npm stop

- If you manually sideloaded the add-in, see Remove a sideloaded add-in.
- Activate add-ins with events
- Implement an integrated spam-reporting add-in
- Troubleshoot event-based and spam-reporting add-ins
- Debug your add-in with runtime logging
