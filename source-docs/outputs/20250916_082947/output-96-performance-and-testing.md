# **Resource limits and performance optimization for Office Add-ins**

09/03/2025

Quality add-ins must performs within specific requirements for CPU core usage, memory usage, reliability, and, for Outlook add-ins, regular expression evaluation response time. These limits help ensure performance for your users and mitigate denial-of-service attacks. Be sure to test your Office Add-in on your target Office application by using a range of possible data, and measure its performance against the following run-time usage limits.

## **Resource usage limits for add-ins**

#### 7 **Note**

The resource limits in this section only apply to Excel, Outlook on Mac (classic), PowerPoint, and Word.

The following runtime resource limits apply to add-ins running in Office clients on Windows and Mac, but not on mobile apps or in a browser.

- **CPU core usage** A single CPU core usage threshold of 90%, observed three times in five-second intervals by default.
If the Office client detects the CPU core usage of an add-in is above the threshold value, it displays a message asking if the user wants to continue running the add-in. If the user chooses to continue, the Office client does not ask the user again during that edit session. The default interval for an Office client to check CPU core usage is every five seconds. Administrators can use the **AlertInterval** registry key to raise the threshold to reduce the display of this warning message if users run CPU-intensive add-ins.

- **Memory usage** A default memory usage threshold that is dynamically determined based on the available physical memory of the device.
By default, when a Office client detects that physical memory usage on a device exceeds 80% of the available memory, the client starts monitoring the add-in's memory usage. This is done at the document level for content and task pane add-ins and at the mailbox level for Outlook add-ins. At a default interval of five seconds, the client warns the user if physical memory usage for a set of add-ins at the document or mailbox level exceeds 50%. This memory usage limit uses physical rather than virtual memory to ensure performance on devices with limited RAM, such as tablets. Administrators can override


this dynamic setting with an explicit limit by using the **MemoryAlertThreshold** Windows registry key as a global setting. They can also adjust the alert interval with the **AlertInterval** key.

- **Crash tolerance** A default limit of four crashes during the document's session.
Administrators can adjust the threshold for crashes by using the **RestartManagerRetryLimit** registry key.

- **Application blocking** A prolonged unresponsiveness threshold of five seconds.
This affects the user's experiences of the add-in and the Office application. When this occurs, the Office application automatically restarts all the active add-ins for a document or mailbox (where applicable), and warns the user which add-in became unresponsive. Add-ins reach this threshold when they don't regularly yield processing while performing long-running tasks. There are techniques listed later in this article to help ensure the addin doesn't block the Office application. Administrators cannot override this threshold.

### 7 **Note**

Although only Outlook on Mac (classic) monitors resource usage, if the client makes an Outlook add-in unavailable, the add-in also become unavailable in other supported Outlook clients.

### **Task pane and content add-ins**

If any content or task pane add-in exceeds the preceding thresholds on CPU core or memory usage, or tolerance limit for crashes, the corresponding Office application displays a warning for the user. At this point, the user can do one of the following:

- Restart the add-in.
- Cancel further alerts about exceeding that threshold. Ideally, the user should then delete the add-in from the document. Continued use of the add-in would risk further performance and stability issues.

## **Evaluation response time for regular expressions in Outlook add-ins**

Outlook add-ins that use regular expressions and run in Outlook on Windows (classic) or on Mac (classic) should observe the following rules on activation.


- **Regular expressions response time** A default threshold of 1,000 milliseconds for Outlook to evaluate all regular expressions in the manifest of an Outlook add-in. Exceeding the threshold causes Outlook to retry evaluation at a later time.
In classic Outlook on Windows, administrators can adjust this default threshold value of 1,000 milliseconds by using a group policy or application-specific setting for the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\WEF\Outlook\ActivationAlertThreshol d DWORD value in the Windows registry.

- **Regular expressions re-evaluation** A default limit of three times for Outlook to reevaluate all the regular expressions in a manifest. If evaluation fails three times, the user must switch to a different mail item then switch back to retry evaluation.
Administrators can adjust this number of times to retry evaluation by using a group policy or application-specific setting. The location of the setting depends on the platform.

- **Windows**: The HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\WEF\Outlook\ActivationRetryLimit DWORD value in the Windows registry.
- **Mac**: The ActivationRetryLimit property list in ~/Library/Preferences .

### **Excel add-ins**

Excel add-ins have important data transfer limits when interacting with the workbook.

- Excel on the web has a payload size limit for requests and responses of **5MB**. RichAPI.Error will be thrown if that limit is exceeded.
- A range is limited to **5,000,000** cells for read operations.

If you expect user input will exceed these limits, check the data before calling context.sync() . Split the operation into smaller pieces as needed. Call context.sync() for each sub-operation to avoid those operations getting batched together again.

These limits are typically exceeded by large ranges. Your add-in might be able to use [RangeAreas](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/excel/excel.rangeareas) to strategically update cells within a larger range. For more information about working with RangeAreas , see Work with multiple ranges simultaneously in Excel add-ins. For additional information about optimizing payload size in Excel, see Payload size limit best practices.

# **Verify resource usage issues in the Telemetry Log**

Office provides a Telemetry Log that maintains a record of certain events (loading, opening, closing, and errors) for Office solutions running on the local computer. This includes resource 


usage issues in an Office Add-in. If you have the Telemetry Log set up, you can use Excel to open the Telemetry Log in the following default location on your local drive.

#### %Users%\<Current user>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Telemetry

For each event that the Telemetry Log tracks for an add-in, there is a date/time of the occurrence, event ID, severity, and short descriptive title for the event, the friendly name and unique ID of the add-in, and the application that logged the event. Refresh the Telemetry Log to see the current tracked events.

The following table lists the events that the Telemetry Log tracks for Office Add-ins.

# **Design and implementation techniques**

While the resources limits on CPU and memory usage, crash tolerance, and UI responsiveness apply to Office Add-ins running only in Office desktop clients, optimization should be a priority if you want your add-in to perform satisfactorily on all supporting clients and devices. Optimization is particularly important if your add-in carries out long-running operations or handles large data sets. The following list suggests some techniques to break up CPU-intensive or data-intensive operations into smaller chunks so that your add-in avoids excessive resource consumption and keeps the Office application responsive.

- If your add-in needs to read a large volume of data from an unbounded dataset, you can apply paging when reading the data from a table, or reduce the size of data in each shorter read operation, rather than attempting to complete the read in one single operation. You can do this through the [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout) method of the global object to limit the duration of input and output. It also handles the data in defined chunks instead of randomly unbounded data. Another option is to use [async](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) to handle your Promises.
- If your add-in uses a CPU-intensive algorithm to process a large volume of data, you can use [web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) to perform the long-running task in the background while running a separate script in the foreground, such as displaying progress in the user interface. Web workers don't block user activities and allow the HTML page to remain responsive. For an example of web workers, see [The Basics of Web Workers](https://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/workers/basics/) .
- If your add-in uses a CPU-intensive algorithm but you can divide the data input or output into smaller sets, consider creating a web service, passing the data to the web service to off-load the CPU, and waiting for an asynchronous callback.
- Test your add-in against the highest volume of data you expect, and restrict your add-in to process up to that limit.

## **Performance improvements with the application-specific APIs**

The performance tips in Using the application-specific API model provide guidance when using the application-specific APIs for Excel, OneNote, Visio, and Word. In summary, you should:


- Only load necessary properties.
- Minimize the number of sync() calls. Read Avoid using the context.sync method in loops for further information on how to manage sync calls in your code.
- Minimize the number of proxy objects created. You can also untrack proxy objects, as described in the next section.

### **Untrack unneeded proxy objects**

Proxy objects persist in memory until RequestContext.sync() is called. Large batch operations may generate a lot of proxy objects that are only needed once by the add-in and can be released from memory before the batch executes.

The untrack() method releases the object from memory. This method is implemented on many application-specific API proxy objects. Calling untrack() after your add-in is done with the object should yield a noticeable performance benefit when using large numbers of proxy objects.

7 **Note**

Range.untrack() is a shortcut for **[ClientRequestContext.trackedObjects.remove(thisRange)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office/officeextension.trackedobjects#office-officeextension-trackedobjects-remove-member(1))**. Any proxy object can be untracked by removing it from the tracked objects list in the context.

The following Excel code sample fills a selected range with data, one cell at a time. After the value is added to the cell, the range representing that cell is untracked. Run this code with a selected range of 10,000 to 20,000 cells, first with the cell.untrack() line, and then without it. You should notice the code runs faster with the cell.untrack() line than without it. You may also notice a quicker response time afterwards, since the cleanup step takes less time.

JavaScript

```
Excel.run(async (context) => {
 const largeRange = context.workbook.getSelectedRange();
 largeRange.load(["rowCount", "columnCount"]);
 await context.sync();
 for (let i = 0; i < largeRange.rowCount; i++) {
 for (let j = 0; j < largeRange.columnCount; j++) {
 let cell = largeRange.getCell(i, j);
 cell.values = [[i *j]];
 // Call untrack() to release the range from memory.
 cell.untrack();
 }
```


```
 }
 await context.sync();
});
```
Note that needing to untrack objects only becomes important when you're dealing with thousands of them. Most add-ins don't need to manage proxy object tracking.

# **Unit testing in Office Add-ins**

Article â€¢ 02/22/2023

Unit tests check your add-in's functionality without requiring network or service connections, including connections to the Office application. Unit testing server-side code, and client-side code that does *not* call the Office JavaScript APIs, is the same in Office Add-ins as it is in any web application, so it requires no special documentation. But client-side code that calls the Office JavaScript APIs is challenging to test. To solve these problems, we have created a library to simplify the creation of mock Office objects in unit tests: [Office-Addin-Mock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/office-addin-mock) . The library makes testing easier in the following ways:

- The Office JavaScript APIs must initialize in a webview control in the context of an Office application (Excel, Word, etc.), so they cannot be loaded in the process in which unit tests run on your development computer. The Office-Addin-Mock library can be imported into your test files, which enables the mocking of Office JavaScript APIs inside the Node.js process in which the tests run.
- The application-specific APIs have load and sync methods that must be called in a particular order relative to other functions and to each other. Moreover, the load method must be called with certain parameters depending on what what properties of Office objects are going to be read in by code *later* in the function being tested. But unit testing frameworks are inherently stateless, so they cannot keep a record of whether load or sync was called or what parameters were passed to load . The mock objects that you create with the Office-Addin-Mock library have internal state that keeps track of these things. This enables the mock objects to emulate the error behavior of actual Office objects. For example, if the function that is being tested tries to read a property that was not first passed to load , then the test will return an error similar to what Office would return.

The library doesn't depend on the Office JavaScript APIs and it can be used with any JavaScript unit testing framework, such as:

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)

The examples in this article use the Jest framework. There are examples using the Mocha framework at [the Office-Addin-Mock home page](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Addin-Scripts/tree/master/packages/office-addin-mock#examples) .

# **Prerequisites**


This article assumes that you are familiar with the basic concepts of unit testing and mocking, including how to create and run test files, and that you have some experience with a unit testing framework.

#### **Tip**

[If you are working with Visual Studio, we recommend that you read the article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/javascript/unit-testing-javascript-with-visual-studio) **Unit testing JavaScript and TypeScript in Visual Studio** for some basic information about JavaScript unit testing in Visual Studio and then return to this article.

### **Install the tool**

To install the library, open a command prompt, navigate to the root of your add-in project, and then enter the following command.

```
command line
```

```
npm install office-addin-mock --save-dev
```
### **Basic usage**

- 1. Your project will have one or more test files. (See the instructions for your test framework and the example test files in Examples below.) Import the library, with either the require or import keyword, to any test file that has a test of a function that calls the Office JavaScript APIs, as shown in the following example.

```
JavaScript
const OfficeAddinMock = require("office-addin-mock");
```
- 2. Import the module that contains the add-in function that you want to test with either the require or import keyword. The following is an example that assumes your test file is in a subfolder of the folder with your add-in's code files.

```
JavaScript
const myOfficeAddinFeature = require("../my-office-add-in");
```
- 3. Create a data object that has the properties and subproperties that you need to mock to test the function. The following is an example of an object that mocks the


Excel [Workbook.range.address](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/excel/excel.range#excel-excel-range-address-member) property and the [Workbook.getSelectedRange](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/excel/excel.workbook#excel-excel-workbook-getselectedrange-member(1)) method. This isn't the final mock object. Think of it as a seed object that is used by OfficeMockObject to create the final mock object.

#### JavaScript

```
const mockData = {
 workbook: {
 range: {
 address: "C2:G3",
 },
 getSelectedRange: function () {
 return this.range;
 },
 },
};
```
- 4. Pass the data object to the OfficeMockObject constructor. Note the following about the returned OfficeMockObject object.
	- It is a simplified mock of an [OfficeExtension.ClientRequestContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office/officeextension.clientrequestcontext) object.
	- The mock object has all the members of the data object and also has mock implementations of the load and sync methods.
	- The mock object will mimic crucial error behavior of the ClientRequestContext object. For example, if the Office API you are testing tries to read a property without first loading the property and calling sync , then the test will fail with an error similar to what would be thrown in production runtime: "Error, property not loaded".

```
JavaScript
```
const contextMock = new OfficeAddinMock.OfficeMockObject(mockData);

#### 7 **Note**

[Full reference documentation for the](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Addin-Scripts/tree/master/packages/office-addin-mock#reference) OfficeMockObject type is at **Office-Addin-Mock** .

- 5. In the syntax of your test framework, add a test of the function. Use the OfficeMockObject object in place of the object that it mocks, in this case the ClientRequestContext object. The following continues the example in Jest. This example test assumes that the add-in function that is being tested is called getSelectedRangeAddress , that it takes a ClientRequestContext object as a


parameter, and that it is intended to return the address of the currently selected range. The full example is later in this article.

```
JavaScript
test("getSelectedRangeAddress should return the address of the range", 
async function () {
 expect(await getSelectedRangeAddress(contextMock)).toBe("C2:G3");
});
```
- 6. Run the test in accordance with documentation of the test framework and your development tools. Typically, there is a **package.json** file with a script that executes the test framework. For example, if Jest is the framework, **package.json** would contain the following:

```
JSON
"scripts": {
 "test": "jest",
 -- other scripts omitted -- 
}
```
To run the test, enter the following in a command prompt in the root of the project.

### **Examples**

The examples in this section use Jest with its default settings. These settings support CommonJS modules. See the [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) for how to configure Jest and Node.js to support ECMAScript modules and to support TypeScript. To run any of these examples, take the following steps.

- 1. Create an Office Add-in project for the appropriate Office host application (for example, Excel or Word). One way to do this quickly is to use the Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins.
- 2. In the root of the project, [install Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) .
- 3. Install the office-addin-mock tool.
- 4. Create a file exactly like the first file in the example and add it to the folder that contains the project's other source files, often called \src .


- 5. Create a subfolder to the source file folder and give it an appropriate name, such as \tests .
- 6. Create a file exactly like the test file in the example and add it to the subfolder.
- 7. Add a test script to the **package.json** file, and then run the test, as described in Basic usage.

### **Mocking the Office Common APIs**

This example assumes an Office Add-in for any host that supports the Office Common APIs (for example, Excel, PowerPoint, or Word). The add-in has one of its features in a file named my-common-api-add-in-feature.js . The following shows the contents of the file. The addHelloWorldText function sets the text "Hello World!" to whatever is currently selected in the document; for example; a range in Word, or a cell in Excel, or a text box in PowerPoint.

```
JavaScript
const myCommonAPIAddinFeature = {
 addHelloWorldText: async () => {
 const options = { coercionType: Office.CoercionType.Text };
 await Office.context.document.setSelectedDataAsync("Hello World!",
options);
 }
}

module.exports = myCommonAPIAddinFeature;
```
The test file, named my-common-api-add-in-feature.test.js is in a subfolder, relative to the location of the add-in code file. The following shows the contents of the file. Note that the top level property is context , an [Office.Context](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office/office.context) object, so the object that is being mocked is the parent of this property: an [Office](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office) object. Note the following about this code:

- The OfficeMockObject constructor does *not* add all of the Office enum classes to the mock Office object, so the CoercionType.Text value that is referenced in the add-in method must be added explicitly in the seed object.
- Because the Office JavaScript library isn't loaded in the node process, the Office object that is referenced in the add-in code must be declared and initialized.

```
JavaScript
```

```
const OfficeAddinMock = require("office-addin-mock");
const myCommonAPIAddinFeature = require("../my-common-api-add-in-feature");
```


```
// Create the seed mock object.
const mockData = {
 context: {
 document: {
 setSelectedDataAsync: function (data, options) {
 this.data = data;
 this.options = options;
 },
 },
 },
 // Mock the Office.CoercionType enum.
 CoercionType: {
 Text: {},
 },
};

// Create the final mock object from the seed object.
const officeMock = new OfficeAddinMock.OfficeMockObject(mockData);
// Create the Office object that is called in the addHelloWorldText
function.
global.Office = officeMock;
/* Code that calls the test framework goes below this line. */
// Jest test
test("Text of selection in document should be set to 'Hello World'", async
function () {
 await myCommonAPIAddinFeature.addHelloWorldText();
 expect(officeMock.context.document.data).toBe("Hello World!");
});
```
### **Mocking the Outlook APIs**

Although strictly speaking, the Outlook APIs are part of the Common API model, they have a special architecture that is built around the [Mailbox](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/outlook/office.mailbox) object, so we have provided a distinct example for Outlook. This example assumes an Outlook that has one of its features in a file named my-outlook-add-in-feature.js . The following shows the contents of the file. The addHelloWorldText function sets the text "Hello World!" to whatever is currently selected in the message compose window.

```
JavaScript
const myOutlookAddinFeature = {
 addHelloWorldText: async () => {
 Office.context.mailbox.item.setSelectedDataAsync("Hello World!");
 }
}
```


The test file, named my-outlook-add-in-feature.test.js is in a subfolder, relative to the location of the add-in code file. The following shows the contents of the file. Note that the top level property is context , an [Office.Context](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office/office.context) object, so the object that is being mocked is the parent of this property: an [Office](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office) object. Note the following about this code:

- The host property on the mock object is used internally by the mock library to identify the Office application. It's mandatory for Outlook. It currently serves no purpose for any other Office application.
- Because the Office JavaScript library isn't loaded in the node process, the Office object that is referenced in the add-in code must be declared and initialized.

```
JavaScript
const OfficeAddinMock = require("office-addin-mock");
const myOutlookAddinFeature = require("../my-outlook-add-in-feature");
// Create the seed mock object.
const mockData = {
 // Identify the host to the mock library (required for Outlook).
 host: "outlook",
 context: {
 mailbox: {
 item: {
 setSelectedDataAsync: function (data) {
 this.data = data;
 },
 },
 },
 },
};

// Create the final mock object from the seed object.
const officeMock = new OfficeAddinMock.OfficeMockObject(mockData);
// Create the Office object that is called in the addHelloWorldText
function.
global.Office = officeMock;
/* Code that calls the test framework goes below this line. */
// Jest test
test("Text of selection in message should be set to 'Hello World'", async
function () {
 await myOutlookAddinFeature.addHelloWorldText();
```


### **Mocking the Office application-specific APIs**

When you are testing functions that use the application-specific APIs, be sure that you are mocking the right type of object. There are two options:

- Mock a [OfficeExtension.ClientRequestObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office/officeextension.clientrequestcontext). Do this when the function that is being tested meets both of the following conditions:
	- It doesn't call a *Host*. run function, such as [Excel.run](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/excel#Excel_run_batch_).
	- It doesn't reference any other direct property or method of a *Host* object.
- Mock a *Host* object, such as [Excel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/excel) or [Word.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/word) Do this when the preceding option isn't possible.

Examples of both types of tests are in the subsections below.

7 **Note**

The Office-Addin-Mock library doesn't currently support mocking collection type objects, which are all the objects in the application-specific APIs that are named on the pattern *Collection, such as WorksheetCollection. We are working hard to add this support to the library.

### **Mocking a ClientRequestContext object**

This example assumes an Excel add-in that has one of its features in a file named myexcel-add-in-feature.js . The following shows the contents of the file. Note that the getSelectedRangeAddress is a helper method called inside the callback that is passed to Excel.run .

```
JavaScript
```

```
const myExcelAddinFeature = {

 getSelectedRangeAddress: async (context) => {
 const range = context.workbook.getSelectedRange(); 
 range.load("address");
 await context.sync();

 return range.address;
```


 } } module.exports = myExcelAddinFeature;

The test file, named my-excel-add-in-feature.test.js is in a subfolder, relative to the location of the add-in code file. The following shows the contents of the file. Note that the top level property is workbook , so the object that is being mocked is the parent of an Excel.Workbook : a ClientRequestContext object.

```
JavaScript
```

```
const OfficeAddinMock = require("office-addin-mock");
const myExcelAddinFeature = require("../my-excel-add-in-feature");
// Create the seed mock object.
const mockData = {
 workbook: {
 range: {
 address: "C2:G3",
 },
 // Mock the Workbook.getSelectedRange method.
 getSelectedRange: function () {
 return this.range;
 },
 },
};
// Create the final mock object from the seed object.
const contextMock = new OfficeAddinMock.OfficeMockObject(mockData);
/* Code that calls the test framework goes below this line. */
// Jest test
test("getSelectedRangeAddress should return address of selected range", 
async function () {
 expect(await
myOfficeAddinFeature.getSelectedRangeAddress(contextMock)).toBe("C2:G3");
});
```
### **Mocking a host object**

This example assumes a Word add-in that has one of its features in a file named myword-add-in-feature.js . The following shows the contents of the file.

JavaScript


```
const myWordAddinFeature = {
 insertBlueParagraph: async () => {
 return Word.run(async (context) => {
 // Insert a paragraph at the end of the document.
 const paragraph = context.document.body.insertParagraph("Hello World",
Word.InsertLocation.end);

 // Change the font color to blue.
 paragraph.font.color = "blue";

 await context.sync();
 });
 }
}
module.exports = myWordAddinFeature;
```
The test file, named my-word-add-in-feature.test.js is in a subfolder, relative to the location of the add-in code file. The following shows the contents of the file. Note that the top level property is context , a ClientRequestContext object, so the object that is being mocked is the parent of this property: a Word object. Note the following about this code:

- When the OfficeMockObject constructor creates the final mock object, it will ensure that the child ClientRequestContext object has sync and load methods.
- The OfficeMockObject constructor does *not* add a run function to the mock Word object, so it must be added explicitly in the seed object.
- The OfficeMockObject constructor does *not* add all of the Word enum classes to the mock Word object, so the InsertLocation.end value that is referenced in the add-in method must be added explicitly in the seed object.
- Because the Office JavaScript library isn't loaded in the node process, the Word object that is referenced in the add-in code must be declared and initialized.

```
JavaScript
```

```
const OfficeAddinMock = require("office-addin-mock");
const myWordAddinFeature = require("../my-word-add-in-feature");
// Create the seed mock object.
const mockData = {
 context: {
 document: {
 body: {
 paragraph: {
 font: {},
 },
```


```
 // Mock the Body.insertParagraph method.
 insertParagraph: function (paragraphText, insertLocation) {
 this.paragraph.text = paragraphText;
 this.paragraph.insertLocation = insertLocation;
 return this.paragraph;
 },
 },
 },
 },
 // Mock the Word.InsertLocation enum.
 InsertLocation: {
 end: "end",
 },
 // Mock the Word.run function.
 run: async function(callback) {
 await callback(this.context);
 },
};
// Create the final mock object from the seed object.
const wordMock = new OfficeAddinMock.OfficeMockObject(mockData);
// Define and initialize the Word object that is called in the
insertBlueParagraph function.
global.Word = wordMock;
/* Code that calls the test framework goes below this line. */
// Jest test set
describe("Insert blue paragraph at end tests", () => {
 test("color of paragraph", async function () {
 await myWordAddinFeature.insertBlueParagraph(); 

expect(wordMock.context.document.body.paragraph.font.color).toBe("blue");
 });
 test("text of paragraph", async function () {
 await myWordAddinFeature.insertBlueParagraph();
 expect(wordMock.context.document.body.paragraph.text).toBe("Hello
World");
 });
})
```

# **Usability testing for Office Add-ins**

Article â€¢ 01/13/2025

A great add-in design takes user behaviors into account. Because your own preconceptions influence your design decisions, it's important to test designs with real users to make sure that your add-ins work well for your customers.

You can run usability tests in different ways. For many add-in developers, remote, unmoderated usability studies are the most time and cost effective. Popular testing services include:

- [UserTesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/)
- [Optimalworkshop.com](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/)
- [Userzoom.com](https://www.userzoom.com/)

These testing services help you to streamline test plan creation and remove the need to seek out participants or moderate the tests.

You need only five participants to uncover most usability issues in your design. Incorporate small tests regularly throughout your development cycle to ensure that your product is user-centered.

#### 7 **Note**

We recommend that you test the usability of your add-in across multiple platforms. To **[publish your add-in to AppSource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace-offers/submit-to-appsource-via-partner-center)**, it must work on all **[platforms that support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/requirement-sets) [the methods that you define](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/requirement-sets)**.

## **1. Sign up for a testing service**

For more information, see [Selecting an Online Tool for Unmoderated Remote User](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/unmoderated-user-testing-tools/) [Testing](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/unmoderated-user-testing-tools/) .

# **2. Develop your research questions**

Research questions define the objectives of your research and guide your test plan. Your questions will help you identify participants to recruit and the tasks they'll perform. Understand when you need specific observations or broad input.


### **Specific question examples**

- Do users notice the "free trial" link on the landing page?
- When users insert content from the add-in to their document, do they understand where in the document it's inserted?

### **Broad question examples**

- What are the biggest pain points for the user in our add-in?
- Do users understand the meaning of the icons in our command bar, before they click on them?
- Can users easily find the settings menu?

### **User experience aspects**

It's important to get data on the entire user journey â€“ from discovering your add-in, to installing and using it. Consider research questions that address the following aspects of the add-in user experience.

- Finding your add-in in AppSource
- Choosing to install your add-in
- First-run experience
- Ribbon commands
- Add-in UI
- How the add-in interacts with the document space of the Office application
- How much control the user has over any content insertion flows

For more information, see [Gathering factual responses vs. subjective data](https://help.usertesting.com/hc/articles/11880238504221) .

# **3. Identify participants to target**

Remote testing services can give you control over many characteristics of your test participants. Think carefully about what kinds of users you want to target. In your early stages of data collection, it might be better to recruit a wide variety of participants to identify more obvious usability issues. Later, you might choose to target groups like advanced Office users, particular occupations, or specific age ranges.

# **4. Create the participant screener**

The screener is the set of questions and requirements you present to prospective test participants to screen them for your test. Keep in mind that participants for services like 


UserTesting.com have a financial interest in qualifying for your test. It's a good idea to include trick questions in your screener if you want to exclude certain users from the test.

For example, if you want to find participants who are familiar with GitHub, to filter out users who might misrepresent themselves, include fakes in the list of possible answers.

#### **Which of the following source code repositories are you familiar with?**

- a. SourceShelf [*Reject*]
- b. CodeContainer [*Reject*]
- c. GitHub [*Must select*]
- d. BitBucket [*May select*]
- e. CloudForge [*May select*]

If you're planning to test a live build of your add-in, the following questions can screen for users who will be able to do this.

**This test requires you to have the latest version of Microsoft PowerPoint. Do you have the latest version of PowerPoint?**

- a. Yes [*Must select*]
- b. No [*Reject*]
- c. I don't know [*Reject*]

**This test requires you to install a free add-in for PowerPoint, and create a free account to use it. Are you willing to install an add-in and create a free account?**

a. Yes [*Must select*]

b. No [*Reject*]

For more information, see [Screener Questions Best Practices](https://help.usertesting.com/hc/articles/11880418598557) .

# **5. Create tasks and questions for participants**

Try to prioritize what you want tested so that you can limit the number of tasks and questions for the participant. Some services pay participants only for a set amount of time, so you want to make sure not to go over.

Try to observe participant behaviors instead of asking about them, whenever possible. If you need to ask about behaviors, ask about what participants have done in the past, rather than what they would expect to do in a situation. This tends to give more reliable results.

The main challenge in unmoderated testing is making sure your participants understand your tasks and scenarios. Your directions should be *clear and concise*. Inevitably, if


there's potential for confusion, someone will be confused.

Don't assume that your user will be on the screen they're supposed to be on at any given point during the test. Consider telling them what screen they need to be on to start the next task.

For more information, see [Writing Great Tasks](https://help.usertesting.com/hc/articles/11880303389213) .

### **6. Create a prototype to match the tasks and questions**

You can either test your live add-in, or you can test a prototype. Keep in mind that if you want to test the live add-in, you need to screen for participants that have the latest version of Office, are willing to install the add-in, and are willing to sign up for an account (unless you have logon credentials to provide them.) You'll then need to make sure that they successfully install your add-in.

On average, it takes about 5 minutes to walk users through how to install an add-in. The following is an example of clear, concise installation steps. Adjust the steps based on the specifics of your test.

**Please install the (insert your add-in name here) add-in for PowerPoint, using the following instructions.**

- 1. Open Microsoft PowerPoint.
- 2. Select **Blank Presentation.**
- 3. Select **Home** > **Add-ins**, then select **Get Add-ins**.
- 4. In the popup window, choose **Store**.
- 5. Type (Add-in name) in the search box.
- 6. Choose (Add-in name).
- 7. Take a moment to look at the Store page to familiarize yourself with the add-in.
- 8. Choose **Add** to install the add-in.

You can test a prototype at any level of interaction and visual fidelity. For more complex linking and interactivity, consider a prototyping tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) . If you just want to test static screens, you can host images online and send participants the corresponding URL, or give them a link to an online PowerPoint presentation.

# **7. Run a pilot test**

It can be tricky to get the prototype and your task/question list right. Users might be confused by tasks, or might get lost in your prototype. You should run a pilot test with 


1-3 users to work out the inevitable issues with the test format. This will help to ensure that your questions are clear, that the prototype is set up correctly, and that you're capturing the type of data you're looking for.

### **8. Run the test**

After you order your test, you'll get email notifications when participants complete it. Unless you've targeted a specific group of participants, the tests are usually completed within a few hours.

### **9. Analyze results**

This is the part where you try to make sense of the data you've collected. While watching the test videos, record notes about problems and successes the user has. Avoid trying to interpret the meaning of the data until you have viewed all the results.

A single participant having a usability issue isn't enough to warrant making a change to the design. Two or more participants encountering the same issue suggests that other users in the general population will also encounter that issue.

In general, be careful about how you use your data to draw conclusions. Don't fall into the trap of trying to make the data fit a certain narrative; be honest about what the data actually proves, disproves, or simply fails to provide any insight about. Keep an open mind; user behavior frequently defies designer's expectations.

# **Validate an Office Add-in's manifest**

Article â€¢ 05/19/2025

You should validate your add-in's manifest file to ensure that it's correct and complete. Validation can also identify issues that are causing the error "Your add-in manifest is not valid" when you attempt to sideload your add-in. This article describes multiple ways to validate the manifest file. Except as specified otherwise, they work for both the unified manifest for Microsoft 365 and the add-in only manifest.

#### 7 **Note**

For details about using runtime logging to troubleshoot issues with your add-in's manifest, see **Debug your add-in with runtime logging**.

### **Validate your manifest with the validate command**

If you used Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit or Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins to create your add-in, you can validate your project's manifest file with the following command in the root directory of your project.

command line npm run validate

### **Microsoft 365 and Copilot store validation**

The validate command also does Microsoft 365 and Copilot store validation but allows developer information like localhost URLs. If you'd like to run production-level Microsoft 365 and Copilot store validation, then run the following command.

```
command line
npm run validate -- -p
```
If you're having trouble with that command, try the following (replacing MANIFEST_FILE with the name of the manifest file).

command line npx office-addin-manifest validate -p MANIFEST_FILE


### **Validate your manifest with office-addin-manifest**

If you didn't use Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit or Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins to create your add-in, you can validate the manifest by using [office-addin-manifest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/office-addin-manifest) .

- 1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/) .
- 2. Open a command prompt and install the validator with the following command.

```
command line
npm install -g office-addin-manifest
```
- 3. Run the following command *in the folder of your project that contains the manifest file* (replacing MANIFEST_FILE with the name of the manifest file).

```
command line
```
office-addin-manifest validate MANIFEST_FILE

```
7 Note
```
If this command isn't working, run the following command instead to force the use of the latest version of the office-addin-manifest tool (replacing MANIFEST_FILE with the name of the manifest file).

command line

npx office-addin-manifest validate MANIFEST_FILE

## **Validate the manifest in the UI of Agents Toolkit**

If you're working in Agents Toolkit and using the unified manifest, you can use the toolkit's validation options. For instructions, see [Validate application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-preview-and-customize-app-manifest#validate-application).
